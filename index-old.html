                            First, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Michelle Brewington. I love everything Pink and
                            Green!
                            My birthday
                            is November 30th. I'm a Saggitarius! I am a proud graduate of TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY! I truly love my
                            HBCU!
                            One of my interests is shopping. Even if it is just window shopping. My second interest
                            is interior designing and party planning. This is where I find my happy place. I love tranforming a
                            space
                            into something beautiful.
                            And lastly, my third interest is baking. I love baking even though my cakes are hit or miss. I love
                            using
                            my husband and son as my
                            guinea pigs although at times they can be brutely honest, but my neice and nephews will always tell
                            me my
                            cakes are delicious even if
                            it tastes like cardboard! Boy do I love my babies!!! Despite it all, I keep pushing on with my
                            baking and
                            one day, I'm going to
                            get it right! And BOOM goes the dynamite!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would say my greatest joy is my family. My son is 18 years old and just graduated from
                            high school and now is a freshman at my alma mater, TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY! I have a sweet neice
                            who just turned 6 years old. She's alot like me!!! I also have 2 nephews. One 9 and the other
                            one is 3. Boy, the 3 year old sure is a handful!!! My stepson is 31! So you see...my family
                            or should I say my kids, range in age vastly. They are the love of my life indeed! And BOOM goes
                            the dynamite once again!!!!!
